                <p><i class="material-icons md-18" style="color:hotpink;font-size: 60px">cloud</i>Now, I like to do yoga, platis and swim in YMCA Bellevue. Except that I really like to code since I took this class. I also like to chat but my oral English is not good. Sometimes I feel so stupid when I talk to someone. </p>
                <p>In school I joined my teacher's program team and I used SSH structure, Windows develop environment, java language, DB is Oracle 11g. So I known a little about progamming but in that situation I didn't try my best to learn the basic knowledge and I really regret that. So I want to try my best to learn Web development basic knowledge.</p>
                <p>I am really cherish this chance to learn how to code. Hope everything goes well and hope everyone could achieve the goal! </p>
